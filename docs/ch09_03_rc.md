# 9.3 Reference Counting: Rc<T> in Rust

This chapter demonstrates the usage, motivation, and caveats of the reference-counted smart pointer `Rc<T>`.

---

## When to Use Rc<T>?

Rc<T> is most useful in these scenarios:

1. **When you want multiple parts of your program to share ownership of some data**  
   *Example: graphs, trees with shared nodes.*
   - Rust's default ownership model enforces a single owner. Rc<T> enables multiple owners by keeping a reference count.

2. **When compile-time ownership rules are too strict for your data structure**  
   *Example: you need to build a structure where nodes are shared (not just a single parent).*  
   - Rc<T> allows you to have several variables pointing to the same data, and the data is deallocated only when all owners go out of scope.

3. **Rc<T> is for single-threaded scenarios**  
   - For multi-threaded sharing, use `Arc<T>` instead.

## Example Code

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;

fn main() {
    // Example 1: Simple shared ownership
    let a = Rc::new(5);
    let b = Rc::clone(&a);
    println!("a = {}, b = {}", a, b);
    println!("Reference count after clone: {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));

    // Example 2: Shared nodes in a list
    #[derive(Debug)]
    enum List {
        Cons(i32, Rc<List>),
        Nil,
    }

    use List::{Cons, Nil};
    let tail = Rc::new(Cons(10, Rc::new(Nil)));
    let list1 = Cons(5, Rc::clone(&tail));
    let list2 = Cons(3, Rc::clone(&tail));
    println!("list1 = {:?}\nlist2 = {:?}", list1, list2);
    println!("Tail reference count: {}", Rc::strong_count(&tail));

    // Rc<T> does not provide interior mutability or thread safety.
    // For mutability, see RefCell<T> or Cell<T>.
    // For thread safety, use Arc<T>.
}
```

## Key Points

- `Rc<T>` is a reference-counted smart pointer for sharing ownership in single-threaded scenarios.
- Use cases:
    1. Shared ownership (graphs, trees with shared nodes)
    2. Overcoming single-owner restriction
    3. Not for mutation or multi-threading
- Rc<T> only allows immutable access to the data. For mutability, combine with `RefCell<T>`.
- For thread-safe sharing, use `Arc<T>`.
